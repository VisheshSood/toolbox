Expand Your Toolbox Using P5.JS
----
This respository helps in teaching users how to use **P5.js**. In this repository, you will find files and instructions to build a **Audio Visualizer**. 

###What Is It?
p5.js is a JS client-side library for creating graphic and interactive experiences, based on the core principles of Processing (parent library). The goal of P5.js is to make coding accessible for artists, designers and beginers to get used to the new programming advances. It is a very simple framework that allows users to draw on canvases on their browser, without the need of too much coding experience. It allows users to draw on the canvas whatever they feel they need to show. These range from animations to still images, to emoticons and portraits using pixel manipulation.
###Advantages and Limitations
One limitation of this library is the fact it runs solely on Javascript, and has nothing to do with HTML (so your code has to be in a separate JS file) each time, and also the library is pretty heavy. One advantage of using this library is that it has a very active development, and since it is open source, the code for this library can be found on [Github] (https://github.com/processing/p5.js). Daily users share issues and developers fix problems very regularly. To put this into perspective, the day I started this assignment (21st of November), there were several commits to the repository. There aren't many famous projects that use P5, however several Art majors and students without programming experience have used it to demonstrate their skills. Examples include [facial recognition](https://gist.github.com/lmccart/2273a047874939ad8ad1), [networking demographics](http://hanbyul-here.net/etc/2014_thesis_network/index.html) and also a way to make GIF files using your webcam, which can be found [here](http://antiboredom.github.io/p5-gif-example/).

###Running This Demo
To run my demo, you can visit [here](http://visheshsd.com/toolbox/) and the code is available [here](https://github.com/VisheshSood/toolbox) on Github. Please do not forget to give access to your microphone, otherwise press T to toggle between the audio sources (Microphone and a custom audio track). If you wish to clone this repository, you will need to use a local web server to run some tools, so I recommend you open the file with [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=paidsearch&utm_campaign=sem2015Q4&utm_content=brand).
